# Baseball wCR+ Predictor
This was a project completeted in Fall 2024 with the goal of using linear regression to predict the offensive performance of baseball players in the 2024 season using data from the preceding season.

The data for the project was gathered from fangraphs.com. A CSV file of all batting data from 2015-2024 is required to be in the directory to run the models. It must be named 'full_data.csv'

### Use
After placing the CSV file in the directory, run each model notebook file one-by-one. After running the models, you may generate predictions by running the 'predictions_2025.ipynb' notebook and inputting which model you'd generate predictions using.
